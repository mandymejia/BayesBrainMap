This package contains functions implementing the BrainMap model proposed in Mejia et al. (2019) and the spatial BrainMap model proposed in proposed in Mejia et al. (2020+). (Previously, these models were named "Template ICA" and were contained in the package [templateICAr](github.com/mandymejia/templateICAr).) For both models, subject-level brain networks are estimated as deviations from known population-level networks, which can be estimated using standard ICA algorithms or provided as a parcellation. Both models employ an expectation-maximization algorithm for estimation of the latent brain networks and unknown model parameters.

BrainMap consists of three steps. The main functions associated with each step are listed below. 

1. Prior estimation: `estimate_prior`. Can export the results with `export_prior`.
2. BrainMap model estimation (single-subject): `BrainMap`.
3. Identification of areas of engagement in each network (or deviation from the prior mean): `engagements`.

If you use `BayesBrainMap` please cite the following papers:

## Installation

You can install the development version of `BayesBrainMap` from Github with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("mandymejia/BayesBrainMap")
```

## Important Notes on Dependencies:

To analyze or visualize CIFTI-format data, `BayesBrainMap` depends on the 
`ciftiTools` package, which requires an installation of Connectome Workbench. 
It can be installed from the 
[HCP website](https://www.humanconnectome.org/software/get-connectome-workbench).

For fitting the BrainMap model with surface-based priors 
(`spatial_model=TRUE` in `BrainMap()`), INLA is required. Due to a CRAN 
policy, INLA cannot be installed automatically. You can obtain it by running
`install.packages("INLA", repos=c(getOption("repos"), INLA="https://inla.r-inla-download.org/R/stable"), dep=TRUE)`. 
Alternatively, `dep=FALSE` can be used along with manual installation of 
dependencies as necessary to avoid installing all of the many INLA dependencies,
most of which are not actually required. Binaries for alternative Linux builds 
can be added with the command `inla.binary.install()`. Note that INLA is _not_
required for standard BrainMap.

Depending on the analysis, PARDISO may reduce computation time. To obtain a free
academic license forINLA-PARDISO, run `inla.pardiso()` in R after running 
`library(INLA)`. Provide an academic email address. Once you obtain a license, 
point to it using `INLA::inla.setOption(pardiso.license = "pardiso.lic")` 
followed by `INLA::inla.pardiso.check()` to ensure that PARDISO is successfully
installed and running.
